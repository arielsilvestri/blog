## Introduction

“Do your own research” – something I have heard time and time again whenever I wade into pro-cryptocurrency and Web3 spaces. It doesn’t matter what knowledge I have or what resources I bring, because my critical views on the fairness of these spaces makes me the enemy, the opposing force to a homogeneous group. Asserting agency to come to my own conclusions is a threat to their order.

There are chilling parallels with the anti-trans voices I've encountered during my transition.

## Transition as an Expression of Your Agency

Consider, for a moment, the following: "When trans folks talk about positive aspects of their transition, what are the common themes? Gender euphoria—that feeling of seeing yourself in the way you’ve always yearned for – is a popular one. Bodily autonomy, self-love, exploration, community are common themes you’ll encounter if you spend some time around transgender folks. <mark>What they all share in common is this concept of agency, through which we assert ourselves and our existence in the face of a hostile world.</mark>

There’s something special about how freeing transitioning feels after years of conformity, building community in ways I’ve never really experienced elsewhere. The resources we have, chiefly the principle of informed consent, open the door for us to explore what we want out of transition, and it is through informed consent that we are given the opportunity to express our agency fully and without resistance.

Opposition to these principles comes in many forms, from assertions of grooming children (a common refrain amongst queerphobic bigots, going back to the 70s and 80s[^fn1]) to “honest questions” about the seriousness with which transgender individuals commit to reflection and understanding of their self before seeking care via informed consent[^fn2]. The threats of self-expression and agency to conformity and the status quo elicits hateful responses from those who have a strong stake in keeping things as static and controlled as possible. Fear permeates cis-normative culture and infrastructure, which sees us as a threat to years of perceived harmony in the world.

This pattern of forced conformity and unquestioning adherence to the status quo keeps appearing in pro cryptocurrency spaces, which use similar tactics and rhetoric to scare large swaths of individuals into empowering a select few who seek to enrich themselves at the expense of those around them.

## Cryptocurrency vs. Agency

Cryptocurrency and associated blockchain-based technologies’ (henceforth just cryptocurrency) existence relies on conformity and belief that its various communities’ version of the world—present and future—is what’s best for everyone. The picture painted for you is one of great fortune and success, all for a reasonable fee. It’s within this predatory nature that the space finds its lifeblood and digs its talons into the people that fall under its sway.

![People are desperate for a way out, for something to belong to, for something to believe in. The future has always seemed to leave them behind. Crypto masquerades as a future of enrichment, selling a dream - that you, an individual, outsmarted the system and profited, that you found the same kind of loophole that you’ve heard the ultra-rich uses, one that allows you to feel as if you’re participating in a kind of counter-culture.](/assets/images/delegitimizing-agency/1.png)

*Don’t worry, you’re ahead of the curve![^fn3]*

When you navigate these spaces as the optimistic speculator, there is a lot of pressure from others in those spaces to keep your resources locked in—you’ll see this referred to as “HODL” or “diamond hands”. Pressure tactics discourage you from withdrawing early or moving out of a project (even if you feel like there’s something wrong), with accusations that you’re NGMI (Not Going To Make It) thrown around if you criticize the less savory aspects of whatever you’re participating in. This process is hostile towards people who ask about the details, even in a space where billions of dollars disappear in the blink of an eye[^fn4]. You’re conditioned to put your agency into the hands of malicious actors, putting yourself at risk of losing everything and more.

<mark>Making informed decisions about the space isn’t totally discouraged, however. Those in power do encourage you to make decisions and weigh trade-offs when investing in new ventures. The ask, of course, is that you don’t look too far beneath the surface</mark>—perhaps the details are too complex for you to understand, or there’s simply too much for one person to really grasp and they should just take the word of those in charge when it comes to the details. Agency stripped, self-expression challenged, a new source of financial income captured and exploited.

Doesn’t this sound a lot like the tactics an abuser uses to groom someone? Prevent them from understanding their circumstances and the intent the abuser has, manipulate them into a specific way of thinking, and then squeeze every little bit out of the victim before moving on to the next. Yet, efforts to fight these abuses committed by those who are bought into cryptocurrency are met with a familiar response: “Do your own research”.

Aren’t we already?

## The Exploitative Nature of Adult Grooming

When I set out to write this, I didn’t know if a theme would emerge. There’s a lot of different ways that these two spaces cross over in an effort to strip you of your agency. I didn’t expect to see so much crossover in how both spaces leverage grooming as a significant tool to accomplish their goals, nor did I realize how similar the tactics both use to manipulate their unsuspecting victims would be.

The key fact to remember here is that grooming is not limited to the sexual grooming of a minor by an adult. Adult grooming exists—it is defined as when someone builds a relationship, trust and emotional connection with someone so they can manipulate, exploit and/or abuse them. 

![Gwyneth Paltrow and Milas Kunas joined a Zoom in January to encourage 5,000 women in the audience to break into the male-dominated world of crypto. "We have watched a lot of these bros get together and earn a lot of money," said Paltrow, sporting a black turtleneck, sun-kissed glow and a disarming smile. "We deserve to be in this space just as much."](/assets/images/delegitimizing-agency/2.png)

{:.image-caption}
*Here, Paltrow and Kunis aren't calling for unity, rather they are promoting exploitation.[^fn5]* 

NFT and other cryptocurrency projects will promote this through predatory inclusion, where marginalized folks get into the project with the promise that we will shatter some glass ceiling and join the ranks of the privileged in society. It’s all a pressure tactic—a means by which you feel like you need to conform to a specific ideology or viewpoint for fear of missing out. Participating opens you up to further forms of exploitation and molding—a cycle of grooming perpetuated viciously and continuously.

You could ask questions about the project, for sure. You could do some light research and see what other individuals in the space think about the prospects. <mark>But they’re just as conditioned as you are, so you end up drawing from the same poisoned well as everyone else.</mark> The community is purposefully contained and insulated, in a way that sharing information in a public manner is actively discouraged and could bring retaliation if you do so. There’s no space for people who are perceived as rocking the boat.

Earlier I wrote about how transphobic individuals will utilize similar tactics to dismantle and discourage support for informed consent. It’s the door these folks open to rally support for their “honest” causes. Transgender athletes are forced off of the field of play, with fifteen states already enacting sports bans in the name of “fairness” for cisgender athletes[^fn6]. Note—there is no verifiable scientific evidence about the “advantage” that transphobic individuals claim transgender athletes have. However, these transphobic individuals will pressure their communities into sharing and spreading their bigoted beliefs using similar fear tactics and social engineering to keep you from understanding and acknowledging trans folks as whole individuals[^fn7], with threats of retaliation and public draggings, both of which bring on days of harassment. It is with that fear that any skepticism of discrimation is converted into skepticism towards the targets of discrimination—the same flavor of fear that crypto project leads use to suppress any objections to their agendas.

Consistent patterns emerge when you look at those who hold the power in crypto spaces and those making arguments of “concern” for the safety of society from transgender individuals. Learning to identify what bigotry and harassment in the crypto community looks like from top to bottom is an effective means of learning how to fight back the crypto tide.

## Mirrors of Harassment

The harassment that occurs from folks deeply embedded in cryptocurrency spaces looks eerily similar to that which I typically encounter in anti-trans spaces. A common refrain emerges as people who are open with themselves criticize cryptocurrency more and more:

![A screenshot of a tweet showing a user replying to @loomdart. It says: "pride flag+pronouns in bio, no surprise once again](/assets/images/delegitimizing-agency/3.png)

{:.image-caption}
*Just one example, but the post I took this from has multiple examples of bigoted statements encouraging harassment of the queer community.*

The above screenshot is emblematic of a common tool in the harassment playbook—it’s one of the oldest tools in the harassment playbook. It rose to prominence when trans folks started encouraging each other to live as loudly as possible online in traditionally heterosexual spaces, a sort of counter-culture built on a foundation of fear and hate. It’s unsurprising that those firmly entrenched in the cryptocurrency community would draw from the Internet Guide To Harassing People, and I wish more prominent critics of the space would call this out when it happens.

“Pronouns in bio” has more sinister offshoots that can spring up—take the following example:

![A screenshot of a tweet that says "if you're a man using pronouns in your bio, you might as well use she/her cause your behavior is that of a woman."](/assets/images/delegitimizing-agency/4.png)

While similar to the first example, there are additional, more direct elements of misogyny and harassment on display here:
- The implication that femininity is weak and that using pronouns makes you weak.
- The implication that using pronouns is “not masculine”, therefore you aren’t allowed to call yourself “a man.”
- The implication that women are “poorly behaved” compared to men.

These harassment tactics serve as a lightning rod for bigots to swarm to and boost, drowning out the dissenting voices that would point out why the viewpoint is wrong and harmful. You can do a search on Twitter for “pronouns in bio” and you will find numerous examples of people spewing vitriol like the above tweets scattered everywhere, with thousands, sometimes tens of thousands, of replies and likes supporting the viewpoint.

One doesn’t need to look that deeply into the cryptocurrency community to find the same, and some of the aforementioned examples definitely come from folks who have clear indicators that they are part of the community: .eth in their handles and numerous crypto-related hashtags in their descriptions, to name a few. The anti-trans and crypto communities are mirroring each other, preparing their attacks on those who exercise their agency and dare to question their intelligence and clout. I can’t tell you that I’m surprised that crypto advocates resort to casual, tired transmisogyny and homophobia—it’s an (unfortunately) easy target to hit the bullseye on. 

## Final Thoughts

Cryptocurrency is a significantly younger space than the transgender community, yet they use the same decades-old tactics used by the dishonest few at the top of the pyramid mimic that transphobes have historically taken, and continue to take. This article barely scratches the surface of the connection between the two, but I hope it gets folks thinking.

Leaders in both communities position themselves as having stronger instincts and more intuition than a skeptic or a critic. They weaponize fear of the unknown and the different, pushing for adherence to what they define as the status quo. Community insulation keeps them in power and strengthens their resolve; we need to be willing to organize and fight against these insidious tactics if we’re ever going to see any positive change. Exercising and legitimizing your agency are the first steps – if you can afford to do so, don’t be afraid to be the loud voice who puts their foot down and says “no” when you feel like something is wrong.
